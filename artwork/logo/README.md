Logo implementation notes
=========================

The `logo.src.svg` file includes all the "work traces" from working on the logo.

Use that one only if you want to get the guide elements to fixup things. That
file mainly makes sense to the author.

Prefer the simplified `logo.svg` file as a source.


Usage notes
-----------

The logo is intended to be used either as-coloured, or monochromatic.

When used monochromatic, prefer using all-black or all-white, depending
on the context.
