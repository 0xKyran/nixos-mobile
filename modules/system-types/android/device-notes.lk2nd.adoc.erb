== Building and installing

There is one tested installation method for your _<%= info["fullName"] %>_.
It relies on flashing one or more partitions on your device
and creating a filesytem for the boot image.

[WARNING]
====
*All installation methods can lead to data loss.*

Flashing a partition *will erase everything on the partition*. Additionally,
the common backups methods, e.g. TWRP, will *not* backup the `userdata`
partition, which may be the installation target.

Make backups.
====

=== Using Fastboot

This will produce a folder with the partition images for
your _<%= info["fullName"] %>_.

 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A build.android-fastboot-images

Alternatively, you can build a specific partition image:

 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A build.android-bootimg
 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A build.rootfs


The device requires the
"[lk2nd](https://github.com/msm8953-mainline/lk2nd)" secondary
bootloader to be installed in the `boot` partition. This runs after
your existing bootloader and does some hardware setup required to
allow mainline kernels to run on your device - as well as providing a
"fastboot" interface for devices that don't already have one.

You can build lk2nd for your device as foilows:

$ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A pkgs.lk2ndMms8953

To install it, reboot into the bootloader (`fastboot` mode), then run

 $ fastboot flash boot result/lk2nd.img

Now you can boot into lk2nd - press Volume Down while booting to enter
Fastboot mode.  If your stock bootloader uses the same key
combinations, you need to wait a bit before pressing the volume
keys. Usually, waiting until the screen turns on and/or the device
vibrates should be enough to make the stock bootloader ignore the
keys.

The suggested filesystem arrangement is to put the Mobile NixOS
`system.img` into the `userdata` partition, and use the `system`
partition for the stage-1 `boot.img` which on some devices is too
large for the `boot` partition. Once running lk2nd you can do this
as follows

 $ fastboot flash userdata result/system.img
 $ fastboot flash recovery result/recovery.img

Now use the up/down keys and power key to select "Recovery mode", then
connect to the device with adb

 $ adb shell
 ~ $ mke2fs  /dev/disk/by-partlabel/system 
 ~ # mkdir /mnt2
 ~ # mount /dev/disk/by-partlabel/system  /mnt2
 ~ # exit

 $ adb push result/boot.img /mnt2
 $ adb reboot
