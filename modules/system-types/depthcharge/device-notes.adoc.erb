== Building

This will build the default output for your _<%= info["fullName"] %>_.

 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A outputs.default

The default output is a disk-image that can be written on a storage media that
your device can boot from.

== Installation

This one is annoying to get started currently. Without a full Mobile NixOS
build, you will need to fill in some gaps manually.

The link:https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/disk-format[
upstream documentation about the disk format] may help shed some light in
understanding how these devices boot.

One of the important thing to realise is that you will likely need to `dd` the
image to a storage media, either external or internal.

The `kpart` output can be used to build only the stage-1, which is helpful for
updating the kernel and the stage-1 boot program.

 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A outputs.kpart

This can be `dd`'d over the first partition on an existing storage media
containing a Mobile NixOS installation.
